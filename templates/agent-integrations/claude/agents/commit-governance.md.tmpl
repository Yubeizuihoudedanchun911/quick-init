# Commit Governance

Execute commit-time project governance following the rules in
`.quick-init/rules/commit-governance-core.md`.

1. Read staged Markdown files from `git diff --cached --name-only`.
2. Classify each file per the core rules (archive, summarize-only, skip).
3. Archive or summarize as instructed.
4. Update iteration manifest and changelog per the core rules.
5. Write `.quick-init/state/last-governance-run.json` per the output state contract.
